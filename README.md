This assignment for ACS-2913-002: Software Requirements Analysis and Design involves creating detailed design documentation for the National Historical Tour Site (NHTS) app. The project covers the following aspects:

1. Agile Use Case Descriptions:
   - **Create User Account**: Describes the process where users input personal information to create an account, receive a unique account number, and access the app's features.
   Create AR Tour Group: This project focuses on tour guides creating an augmented reality (AR) tour group for tourists, allowing them to experience historical sites interactively.

2. **Agile Activity Diagrams**: Visual representation of key activities and workflows related to the app features.

3. Agile System Sequence Diagrams (SSD): Diagrams illustrating interactions between the system and actors for the creation of user accounts and AR tour groups.

4. Agile First Cut Design Class Diagram: The initial class diagram representing the key components and structure of the system.

5. Agile CRC Cards & Sequence/Communication Diagrams**:
   - Communication Diagram: For creating a new tour group and product.
   - Sequence Diagram: For creating a new tour group.
   -CRC Cards: For creating accounts, new tour groups, and adding products.

6. Agile Fully Developed Design Class Diagram: A more detailed version of the class diagram showing interactions and data flow.

7. Agile Class Package Diagram: Organizes the system into distinct layers:
   - View Layer: Includes components like Guide, HistoricalSite, and AR_Elements.
   - Domain Layer: Includes entities such as Customer, UserFeedback, Rating, Address, Account, etc.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the appâ€™s design using agile principles, illustrating workflows, system interactions, and data management for an enhanced user experience.
